==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'codebook.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 60-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'codebook.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- activities = 'activity_labels.txt: Links the class labels with their activity name.

- x_train ='train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- y_train = 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- x_test = 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- y_test = 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

- train_data = merges x and y train data, a column called "train_group" is added

- test_data = merges x and y test data, a column called "test_group" is added

- combined_data = binds the rows from train_data and test_data together, variable names are changed to be more specific, and the levels of activity are changed to descriptive strings  

- tidy_data1 = extracts the mean and standar deviations from combined_data, meanFreq is omitted 

-tidy_data2 = groups the data from tidy_data1 by subject and activity and finds the mean for each participant 

- 'Coursera_Data_Cleaning_Project.rproj': R project file. 

- 'run_analysis.R': R script containing the code 


Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
