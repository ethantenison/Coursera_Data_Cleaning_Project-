The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals time_accelerometer-XYZ and time_Gyroscope-XYZ. These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (time_Body_Accelerometer-XYZ and time_Gravity_Accelerometer-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (time_Body_Accelometer_Jerk_signals-XYZ and time_Body_Gyroscope_Jerk_signals-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (time_Body_Accerometer_Magnitude, time_Gravity_Accerometer_Magnitude, time_Body_Accerometer_Jerk_signals_Magnitude, time_Body_Gyroscope_Magnitude,time_Body_Gyroscope_Jerk_signals_Magnitude). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fourier_Body_Accelerometer-XYZ,fourier_Body_Accelerometer_Jerk_signals-XYZ, fourier_Body_Gyroscope-XYZ, fourier_Body_Accelerometer_Magnitude,fourier_Body_Accelerometer_Jerk_signals_Magnitude, fourier_Body_Gyroscope_Magnitude, fourier_Body_Gyroscope_Jerk_signals_Magnitude. 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in 'features.txt'
